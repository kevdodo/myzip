# Generic archives

These files are simply archives generated by `zip`:

- xkcd: no compression
- cowsay: fixed Huffman compression
- bbrot: single block of dynamic Huffman compression
- zip: multiple blocks of dynamic Huffman compression

We recommend using system `unzip` as a reference to test:

- myunzip0
- deflate (via inflate)
- myzip
- myunzip
